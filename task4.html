<h2 id="headline">Timeline of MS Dhoni's life</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), is a former international cricketer who captained the Indian national cricket team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is currently the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK), a franchise based team of Indian Premier League. Having won the triple ICC limited-overs tournament as captain (inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy) and brought the Indian cricket team to number one position in ICC test rankings in 2009,[3] Dhoni is often considered as the greatest captain of Indian cricket team.[4] Furthermore, he led CSK to win 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021 edition of IPL, becoming second most successful IPL captain after Rohit Sharma.</li>

       <p> Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004 against Bangladesh, and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid. In test cricket his captaincy record was mixed, successfully leading India to series win against New Zealand (in 2009) and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and 2013) against Australia while losing to Sri Lanka, Australia, England, and South Africa by big margins in away conditions. He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014[5] and captain of limited-overs game in 2017.</p>

   
       <pr><li><b>International career</b></li></pr>

    <p> Start of ODI career
        The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[57] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[57] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[58] Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[59] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.[60]  </p>
        <li><b>2007 World Cup</b></li>
        <p>Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded identical 3–1 victories over West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series. Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series.[81] Dhoni, who received a 'B' grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an 'A' grade contract in June 2007. He was also elected as the captain of the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007. On 2 September 2007, Dhoni equalled his idol Adam Gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one.</p>
        <li><b>2015 World Cup</b></li>
        <p>India's preparation, going into the tournament, looked poor as India failed badly in the Carlton Mid Triangular Series in Australia, failing to win a single match. Dhoni himself managed just 70 runs from three innings averaging 23.34. During the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage matches in such a tournament. India achieved wins against arch-rivals Pakistan, South Africa (whom they hadn't beaten before in a World Cup game), the UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe. In the match against Zimbabwe at Eden Park, he made 85 not out chasing 288 and had an unbeaten partnership of 196 with Suresh Raina. This is the highest score by an Indian captain on New Zealand soil. Beating Bangladesh in the quarter finals, he became the third overall and the first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches. In an unsuccessful effort against eventual champions Australia in the semi-finals, he made 65 as India were unable to defend their title. Dhoni, however, performed well with the bat by scoring 237 runs in 6 innings at an average of 59.25 and a strike rate of 102.15 and thus, became only the second Indian captain to have an average over 50 and strike rate over 100 in a particular season of the World Cup,</p>
        
        <li><b>Stepping down as captain and thereafter</b></li>
        <p>Dhoni stepped down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January 2017, just ahead of the ODI series at home against England.[100] In the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, that included a 256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along with Yuvraj Singh. The century, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years.[101] He was named as a wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions Trophy by Cricbuzz.[102] He was also named in the ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz.</p>
